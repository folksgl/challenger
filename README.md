# Challenger

Challenger is my own custom chess engine.

The goal of challenger is to take on the stockfish chess engine, which is currently the best chess engine in the world.

## Progress

Current Level beaten: **None**

Percentage winning next level: **0%**
 
The progress of challenger will be gagued as follows: Challenger will play stockfish at its lowest level. Once the Challenger engine can beat the stockfish engine at the given level at least 50% of the time, the stockfish level will be increased. 
Once Challenger beats stockfish on a given level 50% of the time, the "Current Level Beaten" label above will be updated and a release of the code will be made to snapshot the progress made.
The "Percentage winning next level" label indicates challengers progress in beating the next level of stockfish.

Percentages will be determined by playing 100 games and recording winnings.
